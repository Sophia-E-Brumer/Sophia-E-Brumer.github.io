Whitecaps are the surface signature of air-entraining breaking waves consisting of subsurface bubble clouds and surface foam patches. Easly detectable from ship and airborne visible imagery, the whitecap coverage serves as a proxy for wave breaking related processes. Whitecaps have been studied extensively since the late 1960s because of the role of wave-breaking in the air-sea exchange of gases, and the production of sea spray aerosols.

As wave breaking mainly depends on wind, the whitecap coverage has traditionally been parameterized as a non-linear function of wind speed. However, historical "wind-speed-only" parameterizations exhibit several orders of magnitude scatter. This scatter is thought to be largely due to varying sea state conditions. 

Using the visible imagery collected during the <a href="https://sophia-e-brumer.github.io/projects/SOGasEx/">So GasEx</a>  and <a href="https://sophia-e-brumer.github.io/projects/HiWinGS/">HiWinGS</a> experiments along with wave field and flux measurements, I investigated the dependence of the whitecap coverage on wind speed, wave age, wave steepness, mean square slope, and wave-wind and breaking Reynolds numbers.
