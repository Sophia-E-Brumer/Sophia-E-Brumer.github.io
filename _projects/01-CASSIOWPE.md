The goal of CASSIOWPE project is to develop a coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere model framework to coherently simulate met-ocean conditions in the Gulf of Lion (Mediterranean Sea)  in the prospective of future floating wind farm deployment.
The framework is composed of the mesoscale non-hydrostatic atmospheric model of the French research community Meso-NH, the wave model of the 3rd generation WAVEWATCHIII, and the ocean model CROCO.
My efforts consited in adding the impact of sea spray on momentum and heat fluxes to a chain of coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere models.
In close collaboration with atmospheric and wave modelers from France Energies Marines (FEM) and LOPS as well as with oceanographers specialized in sea spray measurements, I have incorporated new algorithms into SURFEX, the surface model of Meso-NH.
The two bulk algorithms developed can be activated in simulations with different degrees of wave-atmosphere coupling/forcing as well as in stand-alone atmospheric simulations. Several spray generation functions (SSGF) can be activated based on parameterizations derived from published measurements. 
The impacts of sea spray were evaluated through realistic ocean-wave-atmosphere simulations of five case studies in the Gulf of Lion under stormy winds including Mistral and Tramontante.
In order to evaluate the impacts under higher wind conditions, I performed a series of idealized coupled atmosphere-wave simulations of a translating cyclonic vortex. 
A paper is in preparation to describe the developments in SURFEX illustrated by the idealized simulations.
