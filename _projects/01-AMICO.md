AMICO stands for actions towards integrated operational coastal modeling funded by the French ”Minist`ere
de l’Environnement, de l’Energie et de la Mer” in the framework of the COPERNICUS program.
Coupled coastal ocean-wave-atmosphere modeling at high horizontal resolution (400-
1000m) using the ocean Model for Applications at Regional Scale (MARS3D), the third
generation wind and wave model WaveWatchIII (WW3) and the non-hydrostatic mesoscale
atmospheric model of the French research community (MesoNH). I aim to contrast two regions:

1) the Iroise Sea, where a strong tidal current and an intense seasonal SST front interact with mesoscale weather systems and long fetch waves, 
2) the Mediterranean where intermittent upwellings occur due to strong wind events and the tide is weak.
