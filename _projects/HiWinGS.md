In the Fall of 2013 I participated in the High Wind Gas Exchange Study (HiWinGS) cruise aboard the *R/V Knorr* at the invitation of **B. Blomquist**,**B. Huebert**, and **C. Fairall**. 

The HiWinGS data set presents the unique opportunity to gain new insights on the poorly understood aspects of air-sea interaction under high winds and is at the core of my PhD disseration.
