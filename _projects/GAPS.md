 Gas transfer Across Polar Sea ice - Laboratory experiment in the test basin of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Cold Regions and Engineering Laboratory (CREEL). Performed data analysis to study the effects of ice flow coverage  and lead size or fetch on subsurface turbulence and air-sea transfer of heat and gas. This included analysis of InfraRed (IR) imagery: calibration, ice detection, noise filtering, active control flux technique laser tracking and calculation of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates from subsurface acoustic velocity profilers.
