The SO GasEx cruise was the third and most recent cruise of the US led GasEx series initiated in 1998. The main GasEx objective was to improve quantification of air-sea CO2 fluxes and gas transfer velocities. The aim of this third cruise was to examine these processes at higher wind speeds and obtain data in a previously unexplored region. The SO GasEx project focused on a study area around 51ºS, 36ºW, where the *R/V Ronald H. Brown* remained for 37 days having left Punta Arenas, Chile, on 28 February 2008.

While I did not participate in the cruise, I used the data in conjunction with the HiWinGS data to study the dependence of the whitecap coverage and gas trasfer velocities of CO2 and DMS on wind speed and sea state.
