I am a post doctoral researcher working for France Energies Marines and affiliated to the Laboratory of Physical and Spatial Oceanography ([LOPS](http://www.umr-lops.fr/)). Working on the [CASSIOWPE](https://www.france-energies-marines.org/en/projects/cassiowpe/) project I am developping sea spray parameterizations to include in a coupled ocean-wave-amophere model framework to better characterise the metocean environement in which the [Gulf of Lion floating wind farm](https://info-efgl.fr/) is going to be deployed.

Previously I worked for the French National Center for Scientific Research  ([CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/)) at the French Institute for the Explotation of the Sea ([IFREMER](wwz.ifremer.fr/)) in Brest. This was when I first moved to France and joined the LOPS to work on the [Copernicus](http://www.copernicus.eu/) project [AMICO](https://sophia-e-brumer.github.io/projects/AMICO/): Actions vers une Modélisation Intégrée Côtière Opérationnelle. We are working on high resolution fully coupled ocean-waves-atmosphere modelisations of the coastal enviroment. 

My PhD work at the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences ([DEES](http://eesc.columbia.edu/)) at Columbia University in the City of New York focused on understanding wave breaking and the effects of near-surface turbulence on the exchange of momentum, heat, and gases with different degrees of solubility.
