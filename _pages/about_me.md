I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University in the City of New York. My main research advisor is Dr. Christopher Zappa in the division of ocean and climate physics of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

My current research is directed towards understanding wave breaking and the effects of near-surface turbulence on the exchange of momentum, heat, and gases with different degrees of solubility.
