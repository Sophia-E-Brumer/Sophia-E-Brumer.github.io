I am a post doctoral researcher working for the French National Center for Scientific Research  ([CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/)) at the French Institute for  the Explotation of the Sea ([IFREMER](wwz.ifremer.fr/)) in Brest. I joined the Laboratory of Physical and Spatial Oceanography ([LOPS](http://www.umr-lops.fr/)) to work on the [Copernicus](http://www.copernicus.eu/) project [AMICO](https://sophia-e-brumer.github.io/projects/AMICO/): Actions vers une Modélisation Intégrée Côtière Opérationnelle. We are working on high resolution fully coupled ocean-waves-atmosphere modelisations of the coastal enviroment. 

My PhD work at the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences ([DEES](http://eesc.columbia.edu/)) at Columbia University in the City of New York focused on understanding wave breaking and the effects of near-surface turbulence on the exchange of momentum, heat, and gases with different degrees of solubility.
